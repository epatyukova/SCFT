** under development **

This code was written for simulation of microphase separation in mixtures of diblocks or triblocks emitating random copolymer mixtures, such as in the paper "Sequence Fractionation in Symmetric Random Block Copolymers" by A. von der Heydt, et al, https://pubs.acs.org/doi/10.1021/ma100192n or "Nonperiodic Lamellar Phase in Ternary Diblock Copolymer/Homopolymer Blends" by J. R. Naughton and M. W. Matsen, https://pubs.acs.org/doi/full/10.1021/ma025580u. Method used for simulation is standard self-consistent field theory.

In order to run the code you need to specify parameters of simulation in config.json file. Depending on the parameters other files my be required (such as density fields, if sturting from some specific density distribution, or the file with activities, if runing simulation in Grand canonical ensemble).
