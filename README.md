This code was written for simulation of microphase separation in mixtures of diblocks or triblocks emitating random copolymer mixtures, such as in the paper "Sequence Fractionation in Symmetric Random Block Copolymers" by A. von der Heydt, et al, https://pubs.acs.org/doi/10.1021/ma100192n or "Nonperiodic Lamellar Phase in Ternary Diblock Copolymer/Homopolymer Blends" by J. R. Naughton and M. W. Matsen, https://pubs.acs.org/doi/full/10.1021/ma025580u. Method used for simulation is standard self-consistent field theory.
